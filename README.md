# SpecAI
- A web-based image generator that uses Pollinations AI to convert text into digital art, providing users with the ability to define custom resolution (width and height) and the generation seed.

🌐 Project Overview
- SpecAI is a simple and straightforward web application designed to showcase the capabilities of the Pollinations AI image generation API. Its primary features are giving users direct control over two key parameters for reproducibility and formatting:

- Custom Resolution: Set the desired width and height for the output image.

- Seed Control: Input a random numeric seed to reproduce a different image out of the same prompt.

🚀 Access the Site
- The application is hosted and publicly available [here](https://specai.pages.dev/).

Quick Guide
- Enter Your Prompt: Describe the image you want to create (e.g., "A golden retriever wearing a tiny crown, oil painting style").

- Define Dimensions: Input the width and height in the respective fields (e.g., 1280 x 720).

- Set the Seed: Enter a number for the seed. Leaving it blank will display the same image.

- Generate: Click the button to see the AI generate your custom image.
